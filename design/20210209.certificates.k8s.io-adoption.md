## Summary

In Kubernetes v1.19 the
[`CertificateSigningRequest`](https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/48bd8381a38a486f8b3cdf28cf7334a45b182f2e/certificates/v1/types.go#L41)
resource graduated to `certificates.k8s.io/v1`. This makes the concept of
requesting, signing, and consuming certificates in Kubernetes first-class
objects. cert-manager is well placed to serve this resource type as it becomes
more popular in the wider community, whilst preserving all the features and
extensions that cert-manager has to offer.


## Motivation

### Third Party Projects

With the extensiveness of cert-manager’s ecosystem, it is well placed to manage
the core Kubernetes resource type. This gives cert-manager the ability to
integrate with components that it otherwise wouldn't have, without changes to the
third-party project.


### Security

Having the "request" resource managed inside the API server has a better
security profile (i.e. `UserInfo` fields are managed by the API server rather
than a configurable webhook,
[see](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3630)).


### cert-manager Webhook Dependency

Consumers of the certificates.k8s.io `CertificateRequest` do not require
cert-manager as a hard dependency.  cert-manager can cause issues with order of
operation scenarios during installation or upgrades. For example, the
`CertificateRequest` resource needs to be installed and the webhook ready for
consumers/clients of this API to make requests.

In some setups, the cert-manager installation is handled by two separate teams:

- The cert-manager CRDs and webhook are installed and managed by the
  operations team, which allows the operations team to enforce cluster
  policies;
- The cert-manager controller, cainjector and acmesolver are installed and
  managed by the developer team.

By supporting the built-in `CertificateSigningRequest` resource, we decrease the
coupling between the operations team and the developer team.  Since the
`CertificateSigningRequest` resource is built-in, it does not need any
`CustomResourceDefinition` installation, and the webhook for this resource is
integrated to the API server.


### CertificateSigningRequest Migration Path

Support for the `CertificateSigningRequest` resource in cert-manager is a
stepping stone to migrating to this resource instead of the `CertificateRequest`
resource, if the project does indeed want to migrate.


### Goals

* Add `CertificateSigningRequest` signer controllers to cert-manager for all
    `Issuer` types
* Pave a way for replacement of the `CertificateRequest` resource for `CertificateSigningRequest`

### Non-Goals

* Remove the `CertificateRequest` resource before `CertificateSigningRequest` is
    fully supported and a migration path is in place

---

## Reasons for Approach

Below are a summary of properties of the `CertificateSigningRequest` which
cause issues or caveats which need to be addressed when adding support for the
resource.

### Read all access to CertificateSigningRequests

`CertificateSigningRequests` are cluster scoped resources, whereas
`CertificateRequests` are not. This means that in order for users to have the
same debugging and usage capabilities of the `CertificateRequest`, users will
have the ability to list all requests in the cluster, rather than being scoped to
specific namespaces. This is a regression in security.

A solution to this problem could be given to users by providing examples or
guides to external tooling (e.g. [Open Policy Agent
(OPA)](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa), whereby cluster administrators
can limit users access to certain `CertificateSigningRequests` based on label
selectors.


### Namespaced issuers referenced by CertificateSigningRequest

`CertificateSigningRequests` are cluster scoped resources, whereas
`CertificateRequests` are not. cert-manager has the concept of namespaced
issuers that may only be referenced by `CertificateRequests` that reside in
the same namespace. Since `CertificateSigningRequests` can reference any
namespaced `Issuer`, there must be some mechanism to prevent privilege
escalation (Alice references an issuer in Bob's namespace).

cert-manager will enforce an
[RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) noun and
verb whereby the requester must have this role bound to them, in order for the
`CertificateSigningRequest` referencing a namespaced `Issuer` be approved by the
cert-manager controller. See [here](#conditions).

This will be done via a
[`SubjectAccessReview`](https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/4a626d306b987a4096cf0784ec01af1be2f6d67f/authorization/v1/types.go#L52)
against the `UserInfo` fields on the `CertificateSigningRequest`. The required
role must be of `certificates.k8s.io/CertificateSigningRequest` with the verb
`create` within the target namespace.

Since `Certificates` are also namespaced resources, cert-manager validates that
created `Certificate` resources may only reference `Issuers` in the same
namespace, or `ClusterIssuers`. Any resulting `CertificateSigningRequests` will
reference `Issuers` in the same namespace.

### Duration Field

`CertificateSigningRequests` do not include a `duration` field. To have parity
with the `CertificateRequest` resource, the duration field will be moved to an
annotation as `cert-manager.io/duration` which includes a [Go time duration
string](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration.String). This annotation may not
be changed after creation of the `CertificateSigningRequest`.

### CA Field

`CertificateSigningRequests` do not include a `ca` field. To have parity with
the `CertificateRequest` resource, the `ca` field will be moved to an annotation
as `cert-manager.io/ca`. This annotation value contains the base 64 PEM encoded
CA certificate (if one was returned by the signer). This annotation may not be
changed after creation of the `CertificateSigningRequest`.

### External Issuers

All current [external
issuers](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/external/) are built for the
`CertificateRequest` resource. The project should continue to support this
resource indefinitely, and provide an example project for creating external
signers if and when the migration to `CertificateSigningRequests` occurs.


---


## Proposal

cert-manager will support both `CertificateRequest` and
`CertificateSigningRequest` types until, and if, the project completely migrates
to the `CertificateSigningRequest` resource. The `Certificates` controller will
continue to create `CertificateRequest` resources, unless a flag is changed on
the cert-manager controller. This default can be switched in future.

The cert-manager controller will not enable the `CertificateSigningRequest`
controllers unless the resource is available in the running cluster. This can be
checked via the [discovery endpoint of the API
server](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/7279fc64d8478bd5f9d38122143b5e6294f06e75/discovery/discovery_client.go#L55).
If the resource is not available, the `CertificateSigningRequest` controllers
should gracefully never start. If the Kubernetes API server were to be upgraded
to a version that does support this resource, cert-manager would need to be
restarted to make use of these controllers. This is acceptable—worker nodes are
typically always restarted during a cluster upgrade.


Instead of the concept of an `IssuerRef` for `CertificateRequests`,
`CertificateSigningRequests` have the concept of a `SignerName`. Since
`CertificateSigningRequests` are cluster scoped resources, the signer name must
include the namespace, if the referenced `Issuer` is namespaced. The signer name
for cert-manager signers will be prefixed with `cert-manager.io` to prevent
conflicts with other external signer projects.

```yaml
  # Namespaced issuer reference
  # e.g. `issuers.cert-manager.io/my-namespace.my-issuer
  signerName: <resource-name>.cert-manager.io/<namespace>.<issuer-name>

  # Cluster scoped issuer reference
  # e.g. `clusterissuers.cert-manager.iomy-issuer
  signerName: <resource-name>.cert-manager.io/<issuer-name>
```

Using the same approach of referencing by _just_ name, rather than issuer type
(e.g. CA, Vault etc.), keeps the behaviour of this resource in line with
`CertificateRequests` for end users.

Each `CertificateSigningRequest` controller will behave in the same way as the
existing `CertificateRequest` resource, by getting the referenced signer, and
attempting to sign. If the issuer type is not managed by this controller, do
nothing, else sign.


### Signers

Some special cases for some `[Cluster]Issuers` that need to be addressed:

- SelfSigned: Makes use of annotations, and so these annotations should also be
    present on `CertificateSigningRequests`.

- Venafi: Makes use of annotations, and so these annotations should also be
    present on `CertificateSigningRequests`.

- ACME: Makes use of annotations, and so these annotations should also be
    present on `CertificateSigningRequests`.

- ACME: The ACME controller creates sub-resources (`Orders`). Since
    `CertificateSigningRequests` are cluster scoped resources, when referencing
    a `ClusterIssuer` we should create `Orders` in the `Cluster Resource
    Namespace` (default `cert-manager`), else the namespace of the referenced
    `Issuer`.


### Conditions

The `CertificateSigningRequest` has [well-known condition
types](https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/4a626d306b987a4096cf0784ec01af1be2f6d67f/certificates/v1/types.go#L222)
of `Approved`, `Denied`, and `Failed`. All `CertificateSigningRequest` signer
controllers should not begin computation of the request until the resource has
the `Approved` condition set to `True`.

In the absence of further policy, the `Approved` condition is always set t
`True`, _unless_, the `CertificateSigningRequest` references a namespaced
`Issuer` and the requester does not have create permissions for
`certificates.k8s.io/CertificateSigningRequests` in that namespace. In the case
of this namespace validation failing, the `CertificateSigningRequest` `Denied`
condition should be set to `True`, and no signer controllers should process the
request.

If a signer fails when processing a `CertificateSigningRequest`, the well-known
`Failed` condition should be set to `True`. No signer controllers should process
the request again.

If the referenced issuer resource doesn't exist or is not in a ready state, the
corresponding `CertificateSigningRequest` controller should set the `Pending`
condition to `True`.

When the request has been successfully signed, the [cert-manager `Ready`
condition](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/blob/969b678f330c68a6429b7a71b271761c59651a85/pkg/apis/certmanager/v1/types_certificaterequest.go#L139)
should be set to `True` on the resource, to match the same behaviour as
`CertificateRequests`.


### API Changes

* The `cert-manager.io/duration` annotation on `CertificateSigningRequests`
    denotes the requested duration as a Go duration string.

* The `cert-manager.io/ca` annotation on `CertificateSigningRequests` contains
    the returned base 64 PEM encoded CA certificate from the signer.

* The requester of a `CertificateSigningRequest` must have `create` permissions
    for `certificates.k8s.io/CertificateSigningRequests` in the same namespace
    the referenced issuer resides.

* The [Approval
    Condition](https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/4a626d306b987a4096cf0784ec01af1be2f6d67f/certificates/v1/types.go#L222)
    will be replicated on the `CertificateRequest` resource. This condition will
    _always_ be set to true, in the absence of policy. All `CertificateRequest`
    controllers must wait until the `Approved` condition is set to `True` before
    beginning computation.


### Upgrading

No effect to upgrades as only additional controllers added. No CRD API changes.

### Graduation

Below is each level of graduation for support of `CertificateSigningRequest` in
cert-manager.

1. Create signer implementations for each cert-manager.io issuer types. These
   controllers are active in a default cert-manager installation, though
   `CertificateRequests` are the resource created from `Certificate` resources.

1. [TBD] Swap `CertificateRequests` for `CertificateSigningRequests` as the resource
   created from `Certificates`.

1. [TBD] Remove the `CertificateRequest` resource from the cert-manager project,
   in favour of the `CertificateSigningRequest` resource.
